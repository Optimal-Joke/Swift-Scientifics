# Swift Scientifics

Swift Scientifics is a library dedicated to bringing multi-dimensional arrays to Swiftâ€”written in Swift, for Swift. It aims to provide a similar functionality to [`numpy`](https://numpy.org), while presenting it in a modern, user-friendly API. The focus of the library is on the implementation of the `ndArray` struct, but attention will also be paid to implementing linear algebra operations with [Swift Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate), along with various statistical techniques.

This project is still in its very early stages, and it's being developed by a university student in his free time.

## Goals

1. To provide an efficient multi-dimensional array library written entirely in Swift, complete with essential features like indexing, slicing, and broadcasting.

2. Rich and complete reference documentation using Swift's [DocC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc) documentation compiler. Full and complete inline documentation will always be guaranteed from the start. The goal is for tutorials and articles to eventually be available as well.
